# The odd list
I came across this comment on reddit about an amazon interview question. 

>   You have a very large array of integers. One of the integers appears an odd number of times, and all the rest appear an even number of times. Write efficient code to find that integer with the odd count.

## Metrics
I'll be going for real-world performance on ~GB input size. There are probably some other interesting challenges you could do based around this idea.
